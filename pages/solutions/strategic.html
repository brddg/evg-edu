                        EVG starts with research and strategy. No design, words or hype can substitute for understanding your school from the inside out. We will analyze where you are, strategize where you need to go and provide tactics that help you get there as quickly as possible. Our tools include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Digital marketing</li>
                        <li>Branding and messaging</li>
                        <li>Website audit and strategy</li>
                        <li>Social media audit and strategy</li>
                        <li>Competitive and web presence </li>
                        <li>Info architecture and User experience (UX)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        We will not give you vague or unreadable spreadsheets. We will not email you a PDF of graphs and buzzwords. We will provide you with comprehensive audits and strategic documents that help you understand where you are and how you can move the needle.
